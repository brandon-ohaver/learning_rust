# learning_rust

## The Purpose of this project is for me to go through the Rust Book and easily take notes and push up the examples and work I did throughout each chapter. This way I can easily review sections that I may have struggled with or get a refresher on parts of Rust that I may have forgetten about as I later implement my skills to use Bevy and learn DSA stuff.
