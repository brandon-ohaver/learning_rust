# Chapter 3 Section 3: Functions

## Functions are prevalent in Rust code. The most important function within Rust is the `main` function. The `fn` keyword is used to allow the declaration of new functions. Rust code typically uses `snake case` as the conventional style for naming functions and variables, in which letters are all lowercase and underscores separate words.

## Something to remember: Statements in Rust are instructsion that perform some action and do not return a value, which means they have a semicolon at the end of the line. Expressions evaluate to a resultant value, usually with the semicolon being excluded from the end of the line so that they return a value. Adding a semicolon to the end of an expression turns it into a statement!

## Also note: expressions don't require for the `return` keyword to be used, but it will be required if the function needs to return a value early from itself
